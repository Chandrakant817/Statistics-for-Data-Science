## Types of Statistics:

### 1) Descriptive statistics:

It includes analyzing, summarizing, organizing data in the form of numbers and graphs.

Types: 
Measure of central tendency- Mean, mode, median
Measure of dispersion- range, variance, standard deviation

Graphs: bar plot, histogram, pie chart, pdf, cdf, normal distribution etc.

Here we take population or sample data and analyze, summarize, explore , visualize the data in the form of number and graphs.


### 2) Inferential statistics:

It is a technique wherein we use the data that we have measured to form conclusions.

eg: To get exit poll results during elections, we can take different samples from different locations from entire population , we are taking some sample and make inferences about population and coming to a conclusion like which party will win.

We take a sample from population and then we try to do some kind of test and then we come up with some inference and conclusion for that population.

It includes confidence interval , z- test, t-test, chi-square test etc.
